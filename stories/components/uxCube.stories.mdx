When we set the property to preserve-3d, it does two important things:

1、It tells the sides of the cube (the child elements) to be positioned in the same 3D space as the cube. 
If it is not set to preserve-3d, the default value is set to flat , 
and the sides are flattened in the cube’s plane. preserve-3d “copies” the cube perspective to its children (the sides) and allows us to rotate just the cube, 
so we don’t need to animate each side separately.


2、It displays the child elements according to their position in the 3D space, regardless of their place in the DOM.

The `perspective-origin`(
Default value:	50% 50% = center center) property defines at from which position the user is looking at the 3D-positioned element.

When defining the perspective-origin property for an element, it is the CHILD elements that will get the effect, NOT the element itself.
